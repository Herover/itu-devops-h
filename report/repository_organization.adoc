=== Repository Organization

For this project we have chosen a mono-repository setup. 
These work great, and we would consider that the standard unless you end up on a scale where multiple teams will be working on different systems, perhaps in a project involving microservices. 
For our project the scope of the system is rather small, and generally you could make a case for having the backend and frontend in two different repositories. 
However in our case the backend and frontend has a pretty tight coupling, making it not feasible without some intrusive refactoring.
