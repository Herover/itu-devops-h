==== Meetings

We had our meetings as a team every week in the exercise session since it was the best time for everyone to meet up. We mostly discussed about what will be happening from then rather than the done activities, distributed the work of that weekâ€™s exercises and evaluated finished development. Unfinished tasks and long-term tasks just surfaced to see the ongoing development unless it was crucial.

Work divisions for available tasks were overseen at the exercise sessions. While most work division was simple since there were multiple tasks, however, a few tasks were indivisible and forced a group member to focus on them for longer.


==== Work Division and Task/Issue Handling

For the ongoing tasks, online communication was with Discord since it was much faster than meeting up and was quick to evaluate an action. We had a specific channel for our pull requests, we posted our new requests over there for quick checks and notifications for everyone to see.

If any sort of issue happened that was not depending on the current tasks, a message including the details was sent so that it can be investigated.

We only had online meetings when required since face-to-face meetings were suffice, and we shared the information either via messages or GitHub issues. We met online in case we needed to meet-up as a group for a major change, implementation, or an explanation of a hard-to-understand service.
