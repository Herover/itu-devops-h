=== Monitoring

In this section we will go through some of the ways that the system was monitored.

As described earlier we used Grafana to visualize different aspects of the running application. We monitored:

* Results of the following actions in Minitwit:
** Follows
** New messages
** Signups
** Followers' count
** Following count

* Status of the server:
** HTTP errors in the past 24 hours
** API request processing time
** Web request processing time
** HTTP requests
** System uptime

These were used for debugging or checking the health of the server in case of a new merge of code or server faults.

We also have the hardware monitors, e.g., CPU utilization, used RAM for checks etc. if necessary.

The idea is to have views regarding business, development and system metrics, so people with different point of views can see data relevant for them.
