=== Security Assessment

We have multiple tools to scan for security. During CI/CD steps we scan with SonarQube which detects problematic Java dependencies, and Snyk which also detects problematic docker images and libraries in docker images.

Snyk only runs on deployment due to scan limits on our account, but an improvement could be to do regular nightly scans to detect newly discovered security issues in already running services. These scans could also include third party services packaged in Docker such as Drone, PostgreSQL etc.

We also run tools such as Skipfish and WMAP, but found the results confusing as they contained multiple false positives because they interpreted unrelated problems as positive results on their tests.

An XSS vulnerability was found by inserting HTML and JavaScript code into different fields.

We used the following matrix to score various scenarios:

|===
|          | Low impact | Medium impact | High impact 

| Likely   a|image::images/green_square.png[green,14,14]  a|image::images/red_square.png[red,14,14]        a|image::images/red_square.png[red,14,14]          
| Possible a|image::images/green_square.png[green,14,14]  a|image::images/orange_square.png[orange,14,14]  a|image::images/red_square.png[red,14,14]
| Unlikely a|image::images/green_square.png[green,14,14]  a|image::images/green_square.png[green,14,14]    a|image::images/red_square.png[orange,14,14]
|===

We found the following possible scenarios:

1. image:images/orange_square.png[orange,14,14] A high severity vulnerability is found in a third party Java dependency, widespread exploitation leads to information leaks or remote code execution.
2. image:images/green_square.png[green,14,14] A faulty authentication mechanism allows unauthorized users to access other users, leading to information leaks and impersonation.
3. image:images/orange_square.png[orange,14,14] An XSS vulnerability leads to user impersonation, information leaks.
4. image:images/red_square.png[red,14,14] A vulnerability is found in Drone's access management, leading to remote code execution, source code leaks, secrets leaks.
5. image:images/orange_square.png[orange,14,14] A malicious actor gets push access to a code or docker dependency, leading to remote code execution and possible information and secrets leaks.
