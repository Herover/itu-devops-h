=== License

The license chosen for this project is the Apache License version 2.0, which can be found in its entirety in the repository as https://github.com/Herover/itu-devops-h/blob/main/license.md[license.md]. 
This license was chosen after carefully examining the licenses of all dependencies. 
Most of the dependencies were licensed either under Apache License 2.0 or The MIT License, which are both compatible. 
This means that we can bundle our whole project under either of them. 
However two of the dependencies used Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and Mozilla Public License 2.0. 
These are so-called weak copyleft licenses, meaning all modifications need to be open source - however other dependencies, and our own code, will not inherit the copyleft license. 
This means simply noting it as an extension in the end of our license will suffice.
