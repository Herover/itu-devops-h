# How to contribute

The repository is set up as a mono-repository with multiple projects spread out in different
folders. The main branch represents what is currently considered the "working" stable production
code.

Features will be developed in feature branches created from the dev branch and merged into the dev
branch when done. At the end of the week or when considered appropriate the dev branch will be
merged into main.

A feature is considered done when it fixes a issue and at least 1 person has reviewed the code.
How code reviews can be done directly on GitHub or trough other communications channels. How a
good reviews looks like is TBD.

For each week issues are made based on the project work expected from the course that week, and
added to a weekly milestone and a GitHub repository project. Developers have to assign themself to
a project before starting on it so other developers can see what is being worked on. The issues
can be broken down into smaller issues if needed but should be added to the project and possibly a
milestone as well.
